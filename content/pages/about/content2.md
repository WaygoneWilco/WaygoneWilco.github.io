My name is Aaron Martz. I worked on a farm outside of Cross Village in 2017 and fell in love with the area. In 2022 I moved back to the area and am committed to helping the community through my work.

I graduated in 2013 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and am a Certified Water Operator with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. Contact me today to see how we can work together to provide safe water for your employees and customers.
