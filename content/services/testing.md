Deeply contaminated water can “taste clean”. Ensure your water is clear of:
* Nitrates and Nitrites from fertilizers
* Arsenic
* Industrial Chemicals
* PFAS
* And more that we regularly test for

 To avoid negative health outcomes like:
* Bacterial poisoning (dhiarrea, vomiting)
* Chronic health conditiions (slow, accumulating degradation of health)

### Take charge of the health and safety of your family or employees and have your water supply tested. Even if your water tastes "good and clean", it could be contaminated.
